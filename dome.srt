1
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:04,306
Chester's Mill is a place
<i>like any other.</i>

2
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,428
<i>At least, it used to be...</i>

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,566
<i>until we were cut off</i>
<i>from the rest of the world</i>

4
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:10,688
<i>by a mysterious dome.</i>

5
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:16,989
<i>Invisible, indestructible,</i>

6
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:18,574
<i>and completely inescapable.</i>

7
00:00:18,576 --> 00:00:20,410
We're trapped.

8
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:22,245
<i>We don't know
where it came from</i>

9
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:24,414
<i>or why it's here,</i>
<i>but now that we're all trapped</i>

10
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,531
<i>under the dome together,</i>

11
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:27,200
<i>none of our secrets are safe.</i>

12
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:29,085
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

13
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:30,453
<i>Barbie. People
just call me Barbie.</i>

14
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:31,571
<i>It's a nickname.</i>

15
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,622
My husband isn't here,

16
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:33,923
but he'll turn up, you'll see.

17
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:35,425
<i>What do we do when the people</i>

18
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:36,592
start asking about the propane?

19
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,711
That's your business.

20
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:41,097
Duke, is it your pacemaker?

21
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:43,299
Stop!

22
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,934
No one can hear us
all the way down here.

23
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,519
Let me out of here!

24
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,221
Junior.
Dad.

25
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:50,623
You can stay with me.
Come on, I'll give you the nickel tour.

26
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:00,116
Where is it?
I don't have it!

27
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:02,869
Yeah? My boss is not
gonna like that.

28
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:07,824
You got one day.

29
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:09,024
You hear me?

30
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:19,552
Listen, all you've
got to do is pay up.

31
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:23,222
You might want to think
about it, all right?

32
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:25,224
I mean, you don't want
to do anything stupid.

33
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:58,591
Yeah?

34
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:00,593
You all right?

35
00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:02,912
Yep. Fine.

36
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,381
You were, uh,
talking in your sleep.

37
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,916
Yelling, actually.

38
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,853
Is that thing still out there?

39
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:12,138
Yeah, looks like it.

40
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,823
The Hazmat suits haven't left.

41
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:14,924
Julia...

42
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,394
thanks again
for letting me crash here.

43
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:19,612
With my husband missing,

44
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:21,981
and everything
that happened today...

45
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:23,616
it was nice to have the company.

46
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:27,870
I'll see you in the morning.

47
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,206
Great.

48
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:32,775
Did you lose something?

49
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,910
Yeah. You didn't
happen to see

50
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:35,878
a pair of dog tags
around anywhere, did you?

51
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,046
No.

52
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,631
But I'll keep an eye out.

53
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:41,300
Night.

54
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:01,938
Linda! Linda!

55
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,490
What the hell happened?

56
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:05,474
Who shot Duke?

57
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,943
No one shot Duke, Paul.
Calm down.

58
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:09,829
He just got close
to this thing,

59
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:11,113
and his pacemaker exploded.

60
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,481
Ah!

61
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,418
Holy...
If this thing

62
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,652
blows up mechanical things,

63
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,174
then why didn't
Freddy's watch explode?

64
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,756
It's a wind-up.

65
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:22,842
It must only affect things
with batteries.

66
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,326
Either way,
just check the roadblocks

67
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,494
and make sure nobody gets
near this thing.

68
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,762
Well, who's in charge now?

69
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:29,265
You're a cop. Do your job.

70
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:35,104
What about me?

71
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:36,772
We need to take care of Duke.

72
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,695
Joe, wait up!

73
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:43,729
I'm fine.

74
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:44,814
No, you're not.

75
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:45,982
An hour ago,
you were having a seizure,

76
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:47,683
flopping around
like a fish on a hook.

77
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,452
Did I say anything?

78
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:50,987
Yeah, something about... stars.

79
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,238
<i>Pink</i> stars.

80
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,540
Anything you want to tell me?

81
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,375
No.

82
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:57,910
Hey!

83
00:03:57,912 --> 00:03:59,078
Any luck, you guys?

84
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,996
No, not yet!

85
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:02,031
This thing goes down far.

86
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,050
Oh, my God, you know
what all this means?

87
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:06,886
We're so not having
that trig test tomorrow.

88
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,054
Trig.

89
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:09,505
That's a great idea.

90
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:10,706
It is?

91
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,891
I can totally map this thing,

92
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:13,092
see if there's any holes.

93
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:14,310
I'm coming with you.

94
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:15,428
Dude, you don't have to.

95
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,047
Buddy, Lewis had Clark,
you got me, all right?

96
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,548
Come on.

97
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:24,020
Say...

98
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:25,688
did you hear anything more
about the military

99
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,239
- on that contraption of yours?
- Nope.

100
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:30,609
I lost the signal,
but I'm trying to get it back.

101
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,811
It's not as easy as cuing up
the next Van Halen track.

102
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:36,332
Now, why is it that engineers
always act superior to DJs?

103
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:38,284
Because we're smarter, Phil.

104
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:39,735
Negative, sir,

105
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,921
fire is ineffective
against the surface.

106
00:04:41,923 --> 00:04:44,674
But we can confirm
there is no radioactivity

107
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:45,908
emanating from the dome.

108
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,093
They did it again.

109
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:49,261
Second time in 24 hours
they called it a dome.

110
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:51,080
Yeah, I heard him.
No, I don't think you did,

111
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,082
because you'd be
freaking out, too.

112
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,433
We're under a dome, Dodee.

113
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:57,053
Now, this is not just
some invisible wall

114
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:59,254
where a chopper can drop
in and rescue us, man.

115
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:00,439
We gotta tell people.

116
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:01,691
And we will.

117
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:03,258
It's just right now
we only know enough

118
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,277
to scare the crap out of them.

119
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,563
To be continued.

120
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:12,651
♪ Up to second gear,
then come back down ♪

121
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:13,986
♪ Daddy call his boss...

122
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:18,407
Faithful insomniacs,
Phil Bushey here.

123
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:19,825
It's been a long night.

124
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:20,993
And if you're listening to me,

125
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:22,461
it's because
you've got no choice.

126
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:24,830
You see, this barrier thing

127
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:26,716
is blocking
all of the cell phones,

128
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:28,551
TV, Internet...

129
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:30,786
everything in our humble burg
of Chester's Mill.

130
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,388
Now, theories about
what's causing this

131
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,839
range from the North Koreans

132
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:35,424
to a breach
in the space-time continuum...

133
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,126
Well, sorry I didn't
get to you sooner, Rose.

134
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,394
Had to make sure the clinic

135
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:39,795
and the nursing home
were taken care of.

136
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,797
Are you kidding me?
If you're not careful,

137
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,933
people are gonna start
calling you Santa Claus.

138
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:46,769
Oh, God bless you, Jim Rennie.

139
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:47,820
How much do I owe you?

140
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:49,572
Ho, ho, ho.

141
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,325
Oh, my God.
The lights are back.

142
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:56,829
Did that invisible wall
come down?

143
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:58,614
Well, I'm afraid not.

144
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:00,032
But, uh, we've got gennies
up and running,

145
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:01,200
so we have some power,

146
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:02,918
at least get back to
some sense of normal.

147
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,787
I don't believe we've met.

148
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:06,756
Councilman Jim
Rennie, this is Carolyn

149
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:08,841
and, uh, her partner Alice.

150
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:10,843
They're staying
in my spare room upstairs.

151
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:12,178
They're in from L.A.

152
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,130
We got trapped driving
through your little town.

153
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:16,215
We were taking our daughter Norrie to...
To camp.

154
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:17,516
But we have to get out of here.

155
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:18,517
Our daughter is sick.

156
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,668
She had a seizure.

157
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,053
Does your girl have epilepsy?

158
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:22,021
No. It can happen to anyone.

159
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:23,606
Caffeine,

160
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:26,225
sleep deprivation.

161
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:28,360
I've seen it in my patients.

162
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,030
She's a psychiatrist.

163
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:32,181
Well, I'm sorry you ladies

164
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,532
aren't discovering
Chester's Mill

165
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,684
under better circumstances,
but trust me,

166
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,069
if you're gonna be
stuck somewhere,

167
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:39,121
this is the place to be.

168
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:40,823
I've lived here my entire life,

169
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:41,957
and, uh...

170
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,876
...no place
I'd rather call home.

171
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,127
Jim.

172
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,862
I need you to come with me.

173
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,467
Duke's dead.

174
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:59,325
Look at me, damn it!

175
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,285
Anyone?

176
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:14,356
I wouldn't even bother.

177
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,576
I mean, you could strip naked
in front of these guys,

178
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,328
they're still not
gonna pay attention.

179
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,412
I tried that an hour ago.

180
00:07:20,414 --> 00:07:21,831
They didn't even blink.

181
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:24,517
Oh.

182
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,668
I looked around, by the way,

183
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,752
but no sign of your dog tags.

184
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,037
Oh, yeah, no worries.
You know what?

185
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,623
I probably just left
them in my car.

186
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,175
So what makes you think

187
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:35,211
these guys are under orders
not to talk to us?

188
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:37,429
Because they're
not talking to us.

189
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,100
Maybe they did this, you know.

190
00:07:41,102 --> 00:07:42,351
Maybe they're responsible.

191
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:43,853
And why would they do that?

192
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:45,304
I don't know.

193
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:47,273
Could be, uh, an experiment.

194
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:50,109
Some sort of portable
detention camp.

195
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,861
Maybe we're being used
as guinea pigs.

196
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,730
Whatever it is,
these guys are the reason

197
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:55,814
my husband is trapped

198
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:57,483
out there!

199
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,715
ere you heading?

200
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,466
The radio station.

201
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:15,918
They might not
be talking to us,

202
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,553
but they are talking
to somebody.

203
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:44,246
I told you, you're safe with me.

204
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,115
Mr. Rennie!

205
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:47,950
Mr. Rennie!

206
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:50,119
Help! Help!

207
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,587
Mr. Rennie!
Angie...

208
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,372
my dad's not home.
Mr. Rennie!

209
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:55,490
Mr. Rennie!

210
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:57,259
My dad's not home!

211
00:08:57,261 --> 00:08:59,494
Mr. Rennie!
Let go of me!

212
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:01,714
Let go!

213
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,266
No... no!

214
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:05,851
No!

215
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,639
No! No!

216
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,691
Ah! N...

217
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:15,060
Get... off.

218
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:19,865
Get...

219
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,818
What the hell do you want from me?

220
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,187
Look, I just want you
to go back to being

221
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,289
the Angie I knew
before yesterday.

222
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,542
We were doing great,

223
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:31,860
and then this thing

224
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,545
comes down and you...

225
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:36,215
you tell me to take a hike.

226
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,835
I think it scrambled your brain.

227
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:43,205
One of us has a scrambled brain,
all right.

228
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,308
You can't see it, but I can.

229
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:50,379
You're sick, Angie.

230
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,314
But I'm gonna make you better.

231
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:56,718
If I'm so sick,

232
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,104
then why don't you take me
to the hospital?

233
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:01,357
If you care about me so much?

234
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,575
Because he might
still be there.

235
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:07,746
Who might still be here?

236
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,449
The guy I saw you with.

237
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,235
What guy?

238
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,204
Yesterday?

239
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:16,789
Outside the hospital?

240
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,757
Barbie?

241
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,909
The guy who came in
with Mrs. Shumway?

242
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,078
I don't even know him.

243
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,596
Don't play dumb with me, Ange,

244
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:26,248
I can see right through you.

245
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,100
All he did was
give me a cigarette.

246
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:30,102
Uh-huh.

247
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:34,023
What did I ever do to you?!

248
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,776
You loved me.

249
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:39,261
No.

250
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,196
Junior...

251
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,316
I never...
Yes, Angie, you did.

252
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,618
And when this thing comes down,

253
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,404
you're gonna love me again.

254
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:56,128
I will never love you!

255
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:04,169
You were right.

256
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:08,724
That guy...

257
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:10,592
at the hospital,

258
00:11:10,594 --> 00:11:13,095
we didn't just share
a cigarette.

259
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:17,015
He screwed my brains out,

260
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:18,734
and I loved it.

261
00:11:18,736 --> 00:11:21,737
I loved it more
than I ever did with you.

262
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:24,139
You'll never be the man
that he is.

263
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,167
Junior!

264
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:37,669
Junior!

265
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:49,103

266
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:57,689
Holy hell.

267
00:11:57,691 --> 00:11:59,891
He was a good man.

268
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,978
I loved him.

269
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,366
He was like a father to me.

270
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:11,286
He was a good friend.

271
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:13,322
You know, just before he died,

272
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:16,274
he tried to tell me something.

273
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:18,943
Tried telling you what?

274
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:20,111
He said there were things

275
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:21,997
that I didn't know
about Chester's Mill.

276
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:25,467
Things that he needed
to protect me from.

277
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:28,837
What did that mean?

278
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:32,924
I wish I could tell you.

279
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:38,680
What am I gonna do
with another body?

280
00:12:38,682 --> 00:12:40,849
The cemetery is
outside the barrier,

281
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:42,351
and my freezer's full.

282
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:43,902
Show some respect.

283
00:12:43,904 --> 00:12:45,237
This isn't just another body.

284
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,105
This is Duke Perkins.

285
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:48,156
What's that?

286
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:49,408
Turn up your hearing aid,
Lester.

287
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,526
I said this is Duke Perkins.

288
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:54,145
Oh, no.

289
00:12:55,981 --> 00:12:57,666
Oh, good Lord. He's Duke Perkins.

290
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:01,653
Deputy Esquivel,

291
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,673
I'm so sorry for your loss.

292
00:13:05,675 --> 00:13:08,593
Thank you, Reverend Coggins.

293
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:09,994
I should get back out there.

294
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:12,381
Well, you're right, Linda.
Go out there and do your job.

295
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:16,017
I'll make sure Duke here
gets taken care of.

296
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:24,893
You're using our stuff.

297
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:26,061
You're high as a kite.

298
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:28,447
So what? It's Judgment Day, Jim.

299
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,682
I might as well be feeling
the Rapture.

300
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,900
The only reason we got into this

301
00:13:31,902 --> 00:13:33,568
was to try to save
Chester's Mill.

302
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,986
No.

303
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,688
That's the reason Duke went
along with it.

304
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,123
You and I,
we had other priorities.

305
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,325
All right?

306
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,381
I mean...

307
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:48,366
I mean, at least now,

308
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:50,168
we don't have to worry
about him talking.

309
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,721
Real man of God there, Rev.

310
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,808
Come on, let's go.

311
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,310
What? Where are we going?

312
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:00,512
Clean up our mess.

313
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:19,664
Dude, found a way out.

314
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,832
Check it.

315
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,034
You're such an idiot.

316
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,242
It's Joe, right?

317
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:33,011
Yeah, McAlister.

318
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:34,846
Dude, this is the
guy who saved my ass

319
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:35,964
when that plane went down.

320
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:38,133
He totally said
it was raining arms and legs.

321
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:39,351
Yeah, you could say that.

322
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:40,752
What are you up to?

323
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,103
So far, I marked these points,

324
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:43,638
and by measuring the distance
between them,

325
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,524
I was able to come up
with the Y coordinate,

326
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:47,559
and then by multiplying it
by its K integer...

327
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:48,777
He connected the dots.

328
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,946
It's totally gonna be circle.

329
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:53,398
So far, it looks like
it's about ten miles across.

330
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,116
It covers the entire Mill,

331
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:56,618
including some
of Lake Eastpointe.

332
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,786
And you did this?

333
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,539
Yeah, but we're being
really careful.

334
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,774
Keep it up.

335
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,744
Where'd that guy come from?

336
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:07,746
Definitely not from around here.

337
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:09,664
How do you know?

338
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,717
'Cause he's cool.

339
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:14,285
Come on, Dodee,
you just had him.

340
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:15,420
Patience, Philip.

341
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,123
Did you get something?

342
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,559
Shh.

343
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:22,894
Air traffic has been
rerouted around Chester's Mill

344
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,179
until further notice.

345
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:25,463
Continue to monitor
the airspace.

346
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:28,066
What the hell is that?

347
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,841
Jim.

348
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,677
What are you doing?

349
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,128
I was, um,

350
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,599
looking for that.

351
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:07,606
It's Duke's will.

352
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:11,843
Go ahead, read it.

353
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:27,993
He, uh,

354
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:29,661
left me his house.

355
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:31,413
Everything.

356
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:33,031
Of course he did.

357
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,085
He treated you like the daughter
he never had.

358
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:51,516
Now what do we do?

359
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,192
It was a close call.

360
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:02,226
No thanks to you.

361
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:05,330
What was I supposed to do,
phone you?

362
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:06,414
So what'd you find out?

363
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,866
Nothing to do with propane.

364
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,668
Duke must have kept the records
at his house.

365
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,086
Yeah, but it's not
his house anymore.

366
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,070
He left it to the girl.

367
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,588
So you better get over there

368
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,123
before she does.
Me?

369
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,291
What are you gonna do?

370
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:17,792
My job, Lester.

371
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:19,127
Now get out.

372
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:21,262
I'm the only councilman
left in Chester's Mill.

373
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:23,682
I got a town to take care of.

374
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:30,021
You made this?

375
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:31,523
Yeah, I'm only
three credits short

376
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:34,309
of my master's degree
in electrical engineering.

377
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:36,811
Wow. How does it work?

378
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:41,566
Well, this is a harmonic
microwave frequency converter.

379
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,985
It turns low frequency waves
into high frequency waves

380
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,070
so that we can hear them.

381
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:46,788
Maybe you should just
let me hear it?

382
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,606
Okay.

383
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:50,542
Um, sometimes it's
hard to pick up.

384
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:53,628
Further tests reveal

385
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,213
dome appears to be impervious

386
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,015
to high energy lasers

387
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:58,750
and all class-A
corrosive chemicals.

388
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:00,284
We're under a dome.

389
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:02,303
Yeah, that's what
they keep calling it.

390
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:04,139
Why haven't you told anybody?

391
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:06,591
We're not a news station.

392
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,228
Hey, Phil?

393
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,847
And that was some
face-melting rock and roll

394
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:14,482
brought to you by...
I'm going on.

395
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:15,900
I tried to stop her.

396
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:17,769
I'm sorry, what are you doing?
I'm going on the air.

397
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:18,987
No, you can't.

398
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:21,356
This is Julia Shumway
from the weekly <i>Independent.</i>

399
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:24,442
I have some news for all of us

400
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:26,745
stuck here inside
Chester's Mill.

401
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:29,280
I have just learned
that the barrier

402
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:31,082
around Chester's Mill

403
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,667
is being called a dome.

404
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:34,786
This information appears
to be coming

405
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:35,920
from military sources

406
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:38,456
positioned just
outside Chester's Mill,

407
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,592
just outside the dome.

408
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:44,012
We will keep updating you
as information comes in.

409
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:45,547
So stay tuned to...

410
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:47,665
WYBS.

411
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,935
Your only source of news
from under the dome.

412
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:57,025
What does that mean?

413
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:59,561
I have no idea.

414
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,780
I do, Mom.

415
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:05,950
It means we're all gonna die
in here.

416
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,184
This dome
thing, how big is it?

417
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:16,687
No idea.

418
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,854
We're under a dome?
Are we gonna run

419
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,656
out of air?
Until I find out

420
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,974
where Julia got
this information,

421
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:22,976
I think it's best
that we just all stay calm.

422
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:25,145
What if it collapses on us?

423
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:26,280
Great, now the sky is falling.

424
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,949
If we keep our heads
and we stick together,

425
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:31,084
we'll get through this.

426
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:35,789
Hey, "We'll get through this"?

427
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,041
Huh? You don't know what
this dome thing might do.

428
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,160
You're right, but the last
thing we need right now

429
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,095
is for people to panic.
That thing took Duke.

430
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,380
Who's next?

431
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,299
Pull yourself together
and get out on patrol.

432
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,267
People are scared, and
when people are scared,

433
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,518
they start acting stupid.

434
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,554
Yeah, you'd have to be stupid
not to be scared.

435
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,055
You know,
I just hope someone tries

436
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,191
to blow this damn thing up.

437
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,012
Do you think
he's gonna be okay?

438
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,614
He's got to be.

439
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,783
We're gonna need
every man we got.

440
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,039
Think we'll ever see him again?

441
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,691
Who, Rusty?

442
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,460
Come on, Linda.

443
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,712
My brother's not gonna let

444
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,364
some magic bubble thing

445
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,999
keep him from seeing you again.

446
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:21,034
Yeah, that is Rusty.

447
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:22,803
Hey, you know what?

448
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,254
I probably shouldn't be
telling you this,

449
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:28,058
but he's taking you to Hawaii
for your honeymoon.

450
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,479
That dog told me that I had
to settle for Niagara Falls.

451
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,848
Reverend.

452
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,433
Hey.

453
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,768
How you holding up?

454
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,936
We got our hands full,
but I think we'll make it.

455
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,105
Yeah, you're in my prayers.

456
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,283
Julia Shumway,
back with an update.

457
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,786
Additional reports suggest
that the dome

458
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,071
is not radioactive,

459
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,339
but residents are advised

460
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,507
to continue to keep
a safe distance.

461
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,292
And now, something
to take our minds

462
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,344
off all this trouble.
What?

463
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,463
Hey!

464
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:19,026
Hey! Hey, stop! Stop!

465
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,360
What the hell are you doing?

466
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,528
I'm digging my way out.

467
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,697
No, you're not.

468
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,781
What the hell?

469
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,782
Any machine touches that dome,

470
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,900
you're fried.

471
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:28,819
Says who?
Duke.

472
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,405
His pacemaker blew right
out of his chest.

473
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:32,539
He's dead.

474
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,791
Duke's dead?

475
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,626
Who's in charge?

476
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,298
What if we're trapped
in here forever?

477
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,117
I'll never get to make out
with Mila Kunis.

478
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,919
I don't think this thing

479
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:48,221
is the only thing keeping
that from happening.

480
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,957
Just think about it.

481
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,226
We could have met every girl
we're ever gonna meet.

482
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,595
That is so depressing.

483
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:03,636
What the hell?

484
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:08,358
They're doing tests.

485
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,911
Must be checking to see
if water can come through.

486
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,914
Doesn't look good.
We're screwed.

487
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,585
Wait.

488
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:31,298
It's like a sieve.

489
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,966
What the hell's a sieve?

490
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,684
A strainer, douche.

491
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,136
Like-like for pasta?

492
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,672
So it does let water through?

493
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:40,974
Yeah, just a little.

494
00:22:40,976 --> 00:22:42,526
Maybe we can get through.

495
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,111
Aren't we, like, 70% water?

496
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:47,114
Yeah, it's the other 30%
that's the problem, genius.

497
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:55,655
This and, uh, can you give
me a pack of filtered?

498
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,075
Actually, you know what?
Make it three.

499
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:02,162
Anything else?

500
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:03,797
No, that's it.

501
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,839
Thank you.

502
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,314
Didn't anyone ever tell you
smoking's bad for you?

503
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,350
Hey, no,
these-these aren't for me.

504
00:23:23,352 --> 00:23:24,884
It's an investment.

505
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:26,386
We end up getting stuck
in here for a while,

506
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:27,554
you would be surprised

507
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:30,190
what people will swap
for these things.

508
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:34,027
So I'd probably hang onto
that candy bar if I were you.

509
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,342
What's wrong?
You had it working before.

510
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,044
It's not like punching in

511
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,513
the presets on your car radio.
This takes finesse.

512
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,248
Finesse, my ass.
She's just diddling.

513
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,601
Sometimes she gets lucky.

514
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,686
Further tests
reveal the dome appears

515
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,555
to be impervious
to high-energy laser.

516
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,190
How's that for lucky?

517
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,307
Shh.

518
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,393
This is Mobile Ground Unit 2.

519
00:24:06,395 --> 00:24:09,429
After exhaustive testing we are
unable to determine the origin

520
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:10,697
or the composition of the dome.

521
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,982
Oh, my God,

522
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:13,850
the military doesn't know
what it is.

523
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,101
So?

524
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:18,738
So it means they didn't do it.

525
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,290
They're not responsible.

526
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:23,376
Who is?

527
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:30,777
Empty.

528
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,186
Come on. Come on.

529
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:49,629
Hey.

530
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:54,417
What have you got there?

531
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,886
Why are you following me?

532
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,923
So, this is where you did it.

533
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,375
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

534
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:03,643
This is where you screwed her.

535
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,929
I know all about you and Angie.

536
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,098
Who's Angie?

537
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,599
Don't act like you don't know.

538
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:16,906
Looks like she put up
a pretty good fight.

539
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:22,245
She belongs to me.

540
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,281
That's too bad for her.

541
00:26:51,058 --> 00:26:52,592
She still belongs to me.

542
00:26:52,594 --> 00:26:54,761
You just stay
the hell away from me.

543
00:26:54,763 --> 00:26:56,312
Or what?

544
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,901
The next time,
I'm not gonna stop.

545
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:45,245
Ah!

546
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,884
Ah...

547
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:21,948
The Lord works
in mysterious ways.

548
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:34,561
Ah-ah! Ah!

549
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,330
Ah!

550
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:45,089
Help! No! Lord, help!

551
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:01,618
Aw, man.

552
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:07,485
His master must've been
right here.

553
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:10,488
Someone must've dragged
the rest of the body away.

554
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:12,942
Poor fella.

555
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:14,978
The dog's the poor fella?

556
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,447
I kind of feel sorrier
for the cut-in-half dude.

557
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,449
His name's Truman.

558
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:20,917
What're we gonna do with him?

559
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:23,804
We can't just leave him here.

560
00:29:23,806 --> 00:29:26,840
Holy crap. Look.

561
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,258
A fire.

562
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,010
Let's go check it out.

563
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:31,294
Come on, Truman!

564
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,067
You almost killed us!

565
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:56,236
I got something for you.

566
00:29:59,857 --> 00:30:01,324
Paul, what are you thinking?

567
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:03,627
This town is one click away from
total and complete lawlessss.

568
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:04,828
When the time comes, I'm ready,

569
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,362
and you should be, too.

570
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:08,331
We're on the same side here.

571
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,365
Yeah, for now.

572
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:12,035
Who the hell are you?!

573
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:13,420
Easy. That's the guy

574
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:14,921
that saved the McAlister kid

575
00:30:14,923 --> 00:30:16,806
when the plane
crashed in the dome.

576
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:17,924
Linda, you there?

577
00:30:17,926 --> 00:30:20,310
Get out here so I can
see you. Come here.

578
00:30:20,312 --> 00:30:21,895
Go ahead, Jackie.

579
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:23,546
Sarah Martin just drove over.

580
00:30:23,548 --> 00:30:25,599
She says there's a fire
at 223 Pretty Valley Road.

581
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,651
Oh, my God, that's Duke's house.

582
00:30:27,653 --> 00:30:30,020
Get every warm body out there
to help.

583
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:31,488
You can kiss it good-bye--
the entire Chester's Mill's

584
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,356
fire department's out there
and we're in here.

585
00:30:33,358 --> 00:30:36,109
Put that rifle down
and get your ass to Duke's.

586
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:37,360
You're not my boss.

587
00:30:37,362 --> 00:30:38,862
Now.

588
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:44,084
You, warm body. Get in.

589
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,672
Any fire trucks still here?

590
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:51,007
Rusty and his buddies
took them all to Westlake

591
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:52,259
for that damn parade.

592
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:53,843
Clear the line
and get to Duke's.

593
00:30:53,845 --> 00:30:54,961
Damn it, Coggins.

594
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:06,139
Where's the fire department?

595
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:07,724
Right over here! Come on!

596
00:31:07,726 --> 00:31:09,276
Right now, they're coming.

597
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:10,644
Hey, stay back! Stay back!

598
00:31:10,646 --> 00:31:12,362
Stay back!

599
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:16,149
Help! Help!

600
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:19,119
Somebody, somebody help me!

601
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:24,157
Get out of the way!

602
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:33,116
What are you doing here?

603
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:34,551
I heard it on the scanner.

604
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:36,553
What happened?
I have no idea.

605
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:38,338
I'm just glad Duke lived alone.

606
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,056
Come on. Everyone,
please stand back.

607
00:31:40,058 --> 00:31:41,474
Come on.
Keep a safe distance.

608
00:31:41,476 --> 00:31:42,676
We have to put this out.

609
00:31:42,678 --> 00:31:44,144
How the hell are we gonna
do that?

610
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:45,312
You guys still got your
water pressure, right?

611
00:31:45,314 --> 00:31:46,896
So, go and get as many
garden hoses as you can.

612
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:48,515
Go. Go-go-go-go-go-go.
Hey, guys, we need hoses.

613
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:50,166
Go. Go get water.

614
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:51,434
Whose got a hose?

615
00:31:51,436 --> 00:31:53,853
Whose is that right there?
Grab your hose!

616
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:57,474
Excuse me.

617
00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:59,609
Brian, your hose!
Backyard!

618
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:03,646
Barbie.

619
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:06,283
It hasn't rained in weeks.

620
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:07,917
We're inside a damn tinderbox.

621
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,035
If those flames spread

622
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:12,088
to any of these other houses,
it's gonna take

623
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,090
Chester's Mill and us with it.

624
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:17,677
Hey, everybody who does
not have a garden hose,

625
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,629
I want you to go get a bucket,
get a pot,

626
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:21,464
get-get a trash can, something.

627
00:32:21,466 --> 00:32:22,882
Anything that can hold water.
Let's go.

628
00:32:22,884 --> 00:32:24,534
Let's go, get buckets!

629
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:27,354
Help. Please help me!
Someone's inside.

630
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:28,805
Linda!

631
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,142
Somebody help me!

632
00:32:32,144 --> 00:32:33,810
Help!

633
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:54,748
Anybody in here?!

634
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:00,553
Hello?!

635
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:18,772
Linda!

636
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,492
- You okay?
-  Yeah.

637
00:33:22,494 --> 00:33:24,694
What the hell was Coggins
doing in Duke's house?

638
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:26,696
I don't know.
Where did Jim go?

639
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:27,997
- I don't know.
- Get out of here, guys.

640
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,416
There's a propane tank
next to the house.

641
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:30,750
Oh, my God, that's
a propane tank!

642
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:32,168
Let's go, let's go,
get out of here.

643
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,337
Come on, get him out.
Go, go!

644
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,675
The flames are too high.

645
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,207
The hoses aren't cutting it.

646
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:12,701
The fire is
spreading to the shrubs.

647
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:13,935
Get another hose over there.

648
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:15,904
There's not
enough water pressure.

649
00:34:15,906 --> 00:34:17,756
Can you imagine our
neighbors back in Brentwood

650
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:19,374
helping out this way?

651
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:21,409
I don't even know
who our neighbors are.

652
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:22,627
We got to go faster.

653
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:24,629
We got to go faster.
Vic, you holding up all right?

654
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:26,214
Come on, guys, that's right.

655
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:27,382
Just like that. We got to get

656
00:34:27,384 --> 00:34:29,117
more water on this thing,
all right? Come on.

657
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,435
Keep going.

658
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,270
Keep going, everyone.
We got to get more water.

659
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:33,939
Come on.

660
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:36,691
Faster, faster.

661
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:43,198
Keep at it, people.

662
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,566
The fire is spreading
to the fence.

663
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:46,401
The house will be next.

664
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:47,786
Deputy, give me a hand.

665
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,706
Over there, the
bottom of the fence.

666
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,458
Bottom of the fence.
Get more buckets!

667
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,743
Get some buckets in here.

668
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:56,110
The car's on fire.

669
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:58,380
Guys, back, everybody back.

670
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:00,916
This isn't gonna work.

671
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:01,967
It's like playing Whac-a-Mole.

672
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,051
As long as Duke's house
is burning,

673
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:04,453
the fire is just gonna
keep jumping.

674
00:35:04,454 --> 00:35:06,638
Then it's over.

675
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:09,557
Or not. Hey, make some room!

676
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,992
Let's go!

677
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:12,260
Clear the street.

678
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:14,262
Get out of the street.
Let's go.

679
00:35:14,264 --> 00:35:15,847
Hey, back up.
Everybody get back.

680
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,683
Everybody get back.
Let's go.

681
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:20,101
What the hell is Big Jim doing?

682
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:21,186
Is he insane?

683
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:25,073
He's gonna tear down
Duke's house.

684
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:17,042
What the hell happened to you?

685
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,711
I took care of your boyfriend.

686
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:20,879
My boyfriend?

687
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:22,363
The guy you've been screwing.

688
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:25,417
Killed him.

689
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:41,349
No, you didn't.

690
00:36:41,351 --> 00:36:43,551
He's dead, Angie.

691
00:36:43,553 --> 00:36:45,553
He's never gonna touch you ever.

692
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:47,055
I don't believe you.

693
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:48,523
Why not?

694
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:51,659
I've known you
since the third grade, James.

695
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:56,498
Even you couldn't do something
that terrible.

696
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:02,921
That's my Angie.

697
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:07,425
I brought you something.

698
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:19,104
This is what we're working for.

699
00:37:54,957 --> 00:37:56,624
Bucket brigade.

700
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:57,809
Pretty clever.

701
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:59,293
You weren't too shabby yourself.

702
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:01,980
Why, thank you.

703
00:38:01,982 --> 00:38:03,631
Dale.

704
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:04,933
Dale Barbara.

705
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:06,017
I'm guessing that's you.

706
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:07,986
Guilty.

707
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:09,571
Where'd you find them?

708
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:10,655
Uh, you know what,

709
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:12,140
they were actually
just right there,

710
00:38:12,142 --> 00:38:15,243
where I left them, just hanging
over the mirror in you bathroom.

711
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:17,779
Huh. That's the first place
I checked.

712
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:19,581
I must have missed them.

713
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:27,155
How's he doing?

714
00:38:27,157 --> 00:38:29,424
It's lucky Linda got to him
when she did.

715
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,676
Took in a lot of smoke,

716
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:33,361
but I think
he's gonna pull through.

717
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:35,680
Mind if I have a
moment with him?

718
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,601
What the hell you thinking?

719
00:38:39,603 --> 00:38:42,470
You told me
to clean up our mess.

720
00:38:42,472 --> 00:38:43,638
You call this cleaning it up?

721
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,056
How is he?

722
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:48,560
Well, there's someone up there
watching over him.

723
00:38:48,562 --> 00:38:50,645
Thank you for saving me.

724
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:52,113
You're welcome,

725
00:38:52,115 --> 00:38:54,532
but what in the world
were you doing in there?

726
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:57,402
I was, uh...

727
00:38:58,353 --> 00:39:01,623
...getting a suit

728
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,124
for Duke's funeral.

729
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:05,410
I switched on a light,

730
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:09,547
and then I can't really remember
the rest.

731
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:11,199
Must have been a gas leak.

732
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:13,051
The dome's right there
in Duke's backyard.

733
00:39:13,053 --> 00:39:14,886
Probably, uh, severed a line.

734
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:18,173
Well, we're just all glad
you're okay, Reverend.

735
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:20,058
Bless you, child.

736
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,880
Linda,

737
00:39:25,882 --> 00:39:27,882
thank you for saving
the reverend.

738
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:37,558
I'm just...
I'm just doing my job.

739
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,911
Thank you, everyone,
for a job well done.

740
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,729
Well, we couldn't have done
it without you, Big Jim.

741
00:39:41,731 --> 00:39:42,997
Ah...

742
00:39:45,702 --> 00:39:47,035
I appreciate that,

743
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:48,703
but, uh, this isn't about me.

744
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:50,705
It's about all of us.

745
00:39:50,707 --> 00:39:52,840
We stood together,
shoulder to shoulder,

746
00:39:52,842 --> 00:39:54,759
like a town should
in times like these.

747
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:57,745
Now, this is not gonna be
the last crisis

748
00:39:57,747 --> 00:39:59,547
that Chester's Mill faces,

749
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:02,383
but we'll get
through the next one

750
00:40:02,385 --> 00:40:03,601
with the same courage

751
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:06,221
and solidarity
that we showed today.

752
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:08,439
Thank you all.

753
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:11,609
Like hell we will.

754
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:14,562
Go ahead,

755
00:40:14,564 --> 00:40:17,649
pat yourselves on the backs
all you want,

756
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:19,117
but we're toast.

757
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,452
Great, you can put out a fire.

758
00:40:21,454 --> 00:40:22,737
So what?

759
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:25,123
That thing...

760
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,659
that thing is trapping smoke,

761
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,661
and there's no way out.

762
00:40:29,663 --> 00:40:32,280
Hey, come on, man.
Take it easy, Paul.

763
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:33,982
Back up.

764
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:35,883
Hey.

765
00:40:37,754 --> 00:40:39,971
Don't you tell me
to take it easy.

766
00:40:39,973 --> 00:40:41,723
You know, you're just like him.

767
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:43,758
You know, like, you're
lying to these people,

768
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,927
and you're promising that
everything is gonna be okay,

769
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:47,495
and it's not gonna be okay!

770
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:52,350
This thing

771
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:53,434
is never gonna go away,

772
00:40:53,436 --> 00:40:54,635
and we're all gonna die!

773
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:55,937
Paul, don't!

774
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:00,358
Oh, no, no, Freddy!

775
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,976
Freddy?

776
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:06,080
Freddy, stay with me.

777
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:07,699
Freddy!

778
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:09,250
Breathe, stay with me, come on.

779
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:10,651
Stay with me, Freddy.

780
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:16,566
Freddy, Freddy.

781
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:18,129
Freddy!

782
00:41:36,165 --> 00:41:46,731
