subplay
=======

## Motivation

I needed a simple parser/player of .srt files.

### Installing with NPM

```bash
npm install -S subplay
```

### Installing with Bower

```bash
bower install -S subplay
```

## Usage

```javascript
var subplay = require('subplay');

// get hold of an srt as a string
var srt = fs.readFileSync('./mysubs.srt', 'utf-8');

// the second argument is a renderer funtion which
// will be called for every update that is to be
// made to the subtitles.
var update = subplay(srt, function(text) {
    // text is either an (html formatted) text
    // or '' when clearing
    // example of updating a div using jQuery
    $('#mysubholder').html(text);
});

// pass the current time to the update function which
// takes current time in seconds with fractions.
$('video').on('timeupdate', function(ev) {
    // this is 20.5 sec for 20 seconds and a bit into the video
    update(ev.target.currentTime);
});
```

## API

`update = subplay(srt, renderer, opts)` where `srt` is the srt to be played as a
string and `renderer` is a function that will be called every time
there is an update to be made. returns an `update` function which is used
to control where the srt is playing.

`opts.millis` whether the time passed to the update-function are in
millis. otherwise assumed to be seconds. defaults to `false`

`update(time)` start/update the time position of the srt player. the
time passed is in millis or seconds depending on `opts.millis`. a
negative value stops the player. this method can be called as many
times as needed. it will reset/resync the player to whatever position
is passed as argument.
